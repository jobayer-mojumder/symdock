# Symfony Docker Environment

A Docker environment for Symfony framework, similar to Laradock, but tailored specifically for Symfony.

## Getting Started

To use this environment, follow these steps:

1. Configure Environment Variables
Update the env file with your workplace location:

bash
WORKPLACE_DIR=/path/to/your/symfony/project

2. Build and Up Docker Containers
Run the following commands to build and start the Docker containers:

bash
CopyInsert
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
This will build the Docker images and start the containers in detached mode.

3. Access Your Symfony Project
Your Symfony project should now be accessible at http://localhost:8000 (or the port you specified in the docker-compose.yml file).

## Features

This environment includes the following services:

PHP 8.3
MySQL 8.0
Nginx

## Configuration

You can customize the environment by modifying the docker-compose.yml file and the env file.
